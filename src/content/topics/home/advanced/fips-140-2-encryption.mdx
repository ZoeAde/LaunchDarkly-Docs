## Overview

In some customer environments, notably those serving the US government community, there may be compliance requirements to use 
[FIPS 140-2](https://csrc.nist.gov/publications/detail/fips/140/2/final) validated encryption modules.

<Callout intent="alert">
  <CalloutTitle>Complying with regulatory requirements is the customer's responsibility</CalloutTitle>
  <CalloutDescription>

While this guide intends to guide you to meeting your compliance needs, it is up to you to ensure that your encryption practices are 
documented in your SSP and are reviewed by your auditors, to ensure they are applicable and sufficient to your particular needs.

## SDKs

Because the LaunchDarkly SDKs are bundled into your applications, they should inherit the encryption modules used by your application.

For example, in Golang, you can use the 
[BoringCrypto](https://csrc.nist.gov/CSRC/media/projects/cryptographic-module-validation-program/documents/security-policies/140sp3678.pdf) 
experiment flag when building your Go (1.19+) code. The Relay Proxy is a great example of such an application, written in Go, using the 
LaunchDarkly Go SDK.

## Relay Proxy

To build the [LaunchDarkly Relay Proxy](https://github.com/launchdarkly/ld-relay) using BoringCrypto, instead of running `make`
(which in turn calls `go build .`) you can run:

```
GOEXPERIMENT=boringcrypto go build .
```

### Verification

To verify that a Go binary was indeed build with BoringCrypto, there are two methods you can use. The simpler method is to 
call `go version` and check the experiments list. For example (assume the binary we are checking is called `ld-relay`):

```
$ go version ld-relay
ld-relay: go1.19 X:boringcrypto
```

The `X:boringcrypto` indicates that this binary includes the FIPS 140-2 validated encryption modules.

The other method is to examine the symbol table in the binary, looking for BoringCrypto symbols:

```
$ go tool nm ld-relay | grep _Cfunc__goboringcrypto_
```

If this command returns results (and a `0` exit code) then the binary includes the FIPS 140-2 validated encryption modules.
