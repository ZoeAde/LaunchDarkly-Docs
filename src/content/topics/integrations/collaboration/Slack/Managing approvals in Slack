Any reviewers that you added to the approval request will also receive a Slack notification as long as they have authorized the LaunchDarkly app using their email.

## Reviewing approvals in Slack

Here's how to manage approval requests that ask for your review.

- If you want to approve and apply the changes right away, click **Approve and apply**. 
- If you want to approve the changes but not apply them, click into the dropdown and choose **Approve changes**. The original requester, or any account member with a Writer, Admin, Owner, or appropriate custom role can apply the changes you approved.
- If you would not like to approve the changes, choose **Decline Changes**.
- If you only want to comment on the requested flag changes, choose **Comment only**.

4. Add a comment if you'd like to include a comment along with your review.
5. Click **Submit** to submit your review.

## Viewing replies on approval requests in Slack

New approval requests will continue to be recorded in the LaunchDarkly app in Slack. As reviews are submitted, you will receive threaded replies to the original approval request. 

Here's how to see updates to the approval request:
1. Go to the LaunchDarkly app in your Slack account.
2. Click into a thread to view comments, approvals, and declines on the approval request.

Continue to use ## and ### to outline different aspects of the feature. Think about both implementation and post-implementation use--does the reader need to know how to add, edit, manage, delete, or disable things in this feature? Each of those behaviors could have its own section.

If organizing the topic is challenging, ask the docs team for help! Your most important job is making sure the feature is documented comprehensively and correctly, not that the docs are perfect.
