## Overview

This topic explains how to manage approvals for flag changes using the Slack app. Approvals let you request review for changes you plan to make to a flag. You can view and act on approval requests from within the LaunchDarkly Slack app.

To learn more about approvals, read [Approvals](/home/feature-workflows/approvals).

## Viewing approvals in Slack

Here's how to create approval requests and view them with the Slack app:

1. In the LaunchDarkly user interface, navigate to a feature flag, and make a change to the flag. For example, you could update the targeting.
2. Request approval for your changes by clicking the **dropdown icon** and choosing **Request approval**. For more details, read [Requesting approvals](/home/feature-workflows/approvals#requesting-approvals).
3. In Slack, click on the new notification created by the LaunchDarkly app in Slack. The notification contains a link to the approval request.

Any reviewers that you added to the approval request will also receive a Slack notification as long as they have authorized the LaunchDarkly app. To learn more, read [Setting up the Slack app](/integrations/slack/setting-up#setting-up-the-slack-app).

## Reviewing approvals in Slack

Here's how to manage approval requests that ask for your review:

1. Click the Slack notification that you receive from the LaunchDarkly app.

3. Review the targeting changes, and then choose an action for your review.

- If you want to approve and apply the changes right away, click **Approve and apply changes**.
- If you want to approve the changes but not apply them, click into the dropdown and choose **Approve changes**. The original requester, or any account member with a Writer, Admin, Owner, or appropriate custom role can apply the changes you approved.
- If you would not like to approve the changes, choose **Decline changes**.
- If you only want to comment on the requested flag changes, choose **Comment only**.

4. Add a comment if you'd like to include a comment along with your review.
5. Click **Submit** to submit your review.

## Viewing replies on approval requests in Slack

As reviews are submitted, you will receive threaded replies to the original approval request.

Here's how to view updates to the approval request:

1. Go to the LaunchDarkly app in your Slack account.
2. Click into a thread to view comments, approvals, and declines on the approval request.
